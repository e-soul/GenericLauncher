### Generic Launcher

This is a small program that can execute a .bat script without showing the console window. The .bat file name is derived from the .exe file name. For example, if the executable is named `surpass.exe`, when double-clicked (or invoked from a command line) it will search for a file named `surpass.bat` and execute it.

This program is used by [Surpass](https://github.com/e-soul/surpass).
